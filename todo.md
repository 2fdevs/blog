- Move google font css and code styling css to main.css file to avoid extraneous HTTP requests
    => I can't really decide if this is worth the effort - so far I've been too lazy to do this just to reduce a few HTTP requests
- Add Google Analytics
    => I did this, there seems to be issues getting it to work though
