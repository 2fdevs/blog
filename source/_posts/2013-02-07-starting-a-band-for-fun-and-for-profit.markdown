I imagine it's something that a lot of people fantasize about, 
being in a band, traveling and playing for thousands of adoring fans.  
But being in a band is not all picnics and groupies.  Even though you are
doing something you love, it can often be difficult to make money.
That's why I wanted to write a small series of articles about common pitfalls
I've seen bands make over the years, and oftentimes that we made ourselves
when we were playing out.

The number one piece of advice I would give to young bands truly interested in
their own survival is:

> Get yourselves a spreadsheet, ASAP.

A lot of bands don't realize how far they are going into the red.  I know that
we didn't.  Think about it for a moment.  Guitar strings, gas, and Jimmy
John's sandwiches all add up to be a lot, especially over time.  Meanwhile, the ROI
that bands are getting off of gigs, even (especially?) if they have an agent
and various other middlemen involved is rather questionable.

If your average business ran their expenses the way the average band does, they'd be sunk
within a week.  A particularly malevolent form of this lack of consideration for
opportunity costs and liabilities preys on the young, naive, and meek in the form of bands agreeing to play for free
for "invaluable" exposure.

Mark my words: If you're bringing in tons of people like good beer salespeople,
you should be getting paid for it.  And all of the inflows and outflows of cash should
be recorded meticulously in your spreadsheet.  It's a fantastic way to avoid confusion,
resentment, and unfairness later on down the line.
