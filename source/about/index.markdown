Hi there!  My name is Nathan LeClaire and I'm a developer in the Ann Arbor, MI area.  I like programming, travel, and music.  My interests in technology include:

Though I am currently employed I am always interested in talking about other opportunities, particularly involving the interests listed above and in the following cities:

* New York, NY
* San Francisco, CA
* Portland, OR
* Denver, CO
* Austin, TX
* Berlin, Germany
