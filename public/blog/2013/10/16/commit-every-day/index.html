			<p>It is with the greatest of pride that I am announcing today my newest initiative.  I am going to write at least one blog post every week for the next 52 weeks, and I am going to make at least one commit every day- preferably to Github, and most likely on my own personal projects, but bonus points would be given for committing to community projects.  This effort is more than a little inspired by Jennifer Dewalt&#8217;s impressive <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html">180 websites in 180 days</a> project.</p>

<h1>Why Blog?</h1>

<p>Far too long I&#8217;ve toiled away in silence when I could be putting my thoughts, experiences, and gleanings out on the web for all to share.  Many times I&#8217;ve felt the elation of working through a challenging programming issue and having no one to share my triumph with.  With blogging, I hope to alleviate that pain and become a more active member of the business and hacker communities.  I love writing.  Grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary have always come fairly naturally to me as an avid reader.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a well noted phenomenon, too, that teaching something to other people will help you get better at it.  This is also something that I hope will benefit me if I force myself to blog regularly.  For instance, lately I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of coding questions and brushing up on my Java/C/C++ (I learned them long ago, then got embarassingly out of practice) and I hope to solidify some of the core concepts by writing about them.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;d be geeked to get featured on <a href="news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, even if only a few people saw and they were their typical critical selves about it :D</p>

<h1>Why Commit?</h1>

<p><img src="/images/git.png" title="Because it's a joy?" ></p>

<p>I love open source and everything about it.  I&#8217;ve learned so much from reading the source code to things like <a href="https://github.com/coopernurse/gorp">gorp</a> and the Golang libraries that I feel compelled to give back in some way.  At first I will start small with my own projects, but soon I intend to veer into other open source projects as a way of sharpening my coding chops and paying it forward to the community that, in many ways, made me who I am today.  One learns the hard way how frustrating it is when you can&#8217;t fork, modify, or browse the source code of the software that you are using or the website you are accessing.  Working in the proprietary world makes that very clear.</p>

<p>Linux, for instance, is a project for which I have the utmost respect, and the awesomeness of it continues to blow my mind to this day.  The ideals and spirit it embodies are something that I can really get behind, and the &#8220;Bazaar&#8221; nature of the operating system makes for a foundation that leads to a development environment that&#8217;s unparalleled (not to mention performs great on a server).  I defy any contenders to make an honest argument in favor of <code>homebrew</code> over <code>apt-get</code>, for instance.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong- I love <code>homebrew</code> (also notably <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">open source</a>!)- but it&#8217;s clear that Linux package management is on a whole &#8216;nother playing field, and that starts from the ground up.  That can only be explained by the community and attitudes that insist &#8220;If you&#8217;re not satisfied, fork it yourself&#8221;.</p>

<p>Last but not least, seeing my Github commit-tile graph lack so much green (although I know I am committing to closed source software at my day job) makes me kind of sad.</p>

<h1>Why Do Them With Such Fierce Regularity?</h1>

<p><img src="/images/jerryseinfeld.jpg" title="It worked for him." ></p>

<p>Everyone by now is most likely aware (if you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re about to be) of the <a href="dontbreakthechain.com">Jerry Seinfeld Self-Improvement Program</a>.  Essentially, it is a self-improvement technique attributed to Jerry Seinfeld where you pick a goal and make small steps every day towards meeting that goal.  Jerry Seinfeld wanted to become a better comedian, so he made it a goal to come up with a good joke every day and and marked the day off on his calender with a big black &#8220;X&#8221;.  The chain of &#8220;X&#8221;es served to reinforce his sense of making progress, and also as a commitment to continue forward in spite of the possibility (or reality) of failure and disappointment.  I find that kind of tenacity extremely admirable, and I think it will help me hone various skills in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>Thanks for tuning in and I&#8217;ll catch you next week, where I promise there will be much more code involved.</p>
